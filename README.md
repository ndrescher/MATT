# MATT
Mathematics, Algebra, Trigonometry Tutor (Capstone Project)

MATT is C# Windows Form meant to help middle and high school students with their homework by providing them with generic instructions and examples relative to their problem. MATT can help with basic arithmetic, alebra, and trigonometry problems.
To use MATT effectively, the folder of pictures (MATTPics) and the Excel spreadsheet of instructions (MATT_Instructions) needs to be in the same directory as the executable. Having access to these files also gives the user the chance to edit the instructions to reflect their own lessons or lectures on each topic.

Guidelines for entering equations:
-don't put more than one space between any two terms.
-use parenthesis to ensure clarity, especially when using division and exponents.
-use the carat character (^) to indicate an exponent and the asterix (*) to indicate multiplication.

Supported Functions and Symbols:
-sqrt()
-abs()
-log()
-ln()
-sin()
-cos()
-tan()
-csc()
-sec()
-cot()
